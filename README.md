# ReinforcementLearning-Atari
 Playing several Atari games using a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms
## Space Invaders DQN
I used the RAM version (versus the image version) because it doesn't require pre-processing. This game takes a really long time to train because of its complexity and needs at least 10,000 training games to get decent results
